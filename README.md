## 📜 Short about project
This is my small project on python. User selects mode &nbsp;**`encrypt`** or &nbsp;**`decrypt`** and input keys. Program get input from console or from user file depends on user chosen mode, and encrypt user text using four-square cipher which working with 2 keys, output text in console or in file &nbsp;**<code>output.txt</code>**. The same thing happens during decryption, and program decrypt user text instead of encryption. Key may be any text, program filters it and get desired characters.

## 👨🏻‍💻 Getting Started
1. Install python interpreter, if you don't have (or use online interpreters).
2. Clone this repo or copy code from file &nbsp;**`encryptor.py`**
3. Put it in python interpreter.
4. If you want to input your text from a file, create your own input.txt file, and write your text there.
5. Run code.
6. Congrats! Now you can encrypt your secret text and send it to your friends without worrying about its safety because without a decryptor it's just a bunch of incomprehensible characters :)
